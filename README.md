### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a robotic developer from Italy, who loves everything that is programmable, and is currently working at his own little project [autonomousApp](https://github.com/armBray/autonomousApp).
I mainly code in ROS, which requires good knowledge of C++ and Python, but I always challenge myself by integrating my knowledge with new developement skills such as Html, css, Javascript, Typescript, React, Bootstrap and SQL.
